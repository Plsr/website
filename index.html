  <h2>Projects</h2>
  Some projects I'm currently working on or have been working on in the past:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a class="HomePage-StyledLink" href="https://github.com/Plsr/25knots">25knots</a>: The project I built as part of my bachelor thesis. It's a tool that helps with doing basic UI design decisions. Written in React.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a class="HomePage-StyledLink" href="https://github.com/Plsr/DoDee">DoDee</a>: A simple ToDo-List that I build with concepts in mind that I thought I wanted a ToDo-List to have. This was written in Vue.js (my first ever project), since I needed to learn it for a project at work.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a class="HomePage-StyledLink" href="https://github.com/Plsr/cilatl">Cool, I'll look at that later</a>: A bookmarking service that I'm in the process of building. Written in Ruby on Rails.
