During my last holiday, I opened the car door and my iPad Air 2 fell out, which resulted in a *badly* shatterd screen. It is still working, but its days are probably counted. So I have been looking for a replacement in the last few days. There are a few things that I noticed.

First, it has gotten insanely hard to pick a new iPad. For my first iPad, it was just the decision that I wanted an iPad, and then I bought it the one version that was available. For my iPad Mini, I had to decide if I wanted a big one or a small one.    
Here is what I had to deal with lately: Since the pro line is out of the pool (I cannot justify spending *that* much money on a leisure device), I have the regular 2019 iPad, the iPad Air 3 and the iPad Mini 5 to choose from. But that's not all. Since I only really care about Apple Pen support, there is also the 2018 regular iPad, which does not differ from this years version except for the new keyboard connector, but is a lot cheaper. And, if I were to buy the iPad Air 3, I could as well look for a cheap 2017 iPad Pro for about the same price, which has similar stats but seems to be nicer to use with the pen.

Second, I'm not sure if I really want an iPad. I currently only use it for consumption, which is YouTube and Netflix most of the time. I want to spend less time on both of these platforms, so not having an iPad in the house as an enabler would be helpful.  
Most of the usecases of the iPad bring a version of myself to my mind that I would like to be: Saving article drafts to PDF and editing them with the pen, writing articles on there, doing email, taking notes. But I'm not sure I would as well do all these things once I have the device or if I'm just using those ideas to justify the purchase to myself.
