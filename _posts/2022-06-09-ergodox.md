In September 2021 I bought a keyboard with a weird key arrangement that was split in half for a lot of money.
I've been using it for almost daily for the last 9 months. Following are some thoughts on the keyboard that neither complete,
nor very structured and should under no circumstances be understood as a full review.

I will be critically talking about some aspects of the keyboard in the following. While reading, please keep in mind 
that I like the keyboard a lot and am very happy with it.

## The hardware & build quality

All in all, the Ergodox EZ is built really well. It's almost completely plastic, but it does not feel cheap at all. I
did not do any modifications on it at all, so even though I have a version with tactile switches, the case makes it a 
rather loud keyboard. It does not sound nearly as good as my Niu Mini with a aluminium case and loubed Kailh Burnt 
Orange switches, but I can live with that. The stock keycaps feel good and have a nice profile. As stated before, I'm 
really happy with the board, I'd wholeheartedly recommed buying one if you want an assambled split ortho keyboard.

That said, I want to talk about a few things that I do not like as much about the board.

The **feet from the tilt/tent kit** are hard to get in the right spot. With the tenting kit, the keyboard has three feet 
attached to it that can be adjusted in small steps to give the keyboard an angle. I like using it at an angle, it feels
weird to use it when it's just lying flat on the table.  
However, it is not that easy to first of all find a setting that ensures the keyboard does not move while typing. It's 
even harder to get both parts to have the same angle **and** not wiggle. The step mechanism on the feet is not great as 
well. Often time, I fixate a leg and once some pressure is applied to it, it "snaps" to the next position, making the 
half of the keyboard instable.

The stock **wrist rests** are not my favourite. I don't know what exactly they are made of, but it feels like some kind of
hard rubber. While they are at a nice sweetspot between wood and cloth, the material
tends to get filthy after a short while and starts collecting all kinds of dust and hair from my desk.

## The layout
There are objective arguments to be made on ortholinear layouts, split keyboards and also orhtolinear split keyboards.
I don't want to go into those in the post, so I'll just stick with my personal experience. I type better (i.e. more accurate)
on an ortholinear layout. I just don't seem to mess up keys as much. My arms and shoulders feel better with a split board.
Natuarlly, the Ergodox layout is very comfortable to me. It took me a weekend to get functional with the layout and about
two weeks to get back to my regular typing speed.

What I like about the Ergodox layout in specific is the thumb cluster. The position feels like a very natuarl place for
my thumbs to rest. This goes for the firs to big keys, at least. For everything else on there, I have to stretch my 
hands so far that I have to lift them from the home row. As my layouts evolved, those button get assinged less and less.

There are also three keys to the inner side of each half that are okay to reach for the most part. When starting out, I
set some core keys (esc for example) on those. Since I try to make use of less keys and more layers currently, I have
some utility functions on those. On the left side, the two big keys are copy and paste, which is comfotable when selecting
something with the mouse.  
For what it's worth, I think the moonlander has the superior layout and removes a lot of the pain points I currently have.

## Software
The software is just great, period. ZSA encourages you to use [Oryx]() for managing your layouts, which is basically a 
web UI for [qmk](), and a good one. It makes configuring and adapting layouts easy and keeps a list of revisions of a 
layout for. Up until this point, I've adapted my layout 15 time to arrive at my [current layout](https://configure.zsa.io/ergodox-ez/layouts/YyOGP/Zv9qV/0).

For flashing the firmware onto the board, you just download [wally](https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/wally), choose the file
and press a button on the board. It' actually so easy and fast to do that I changed my layout today in the middle of
writing a commit message without leaving insert mode.

_Maybe something about how making this easy is removing on frustriating point in the beginning?_

## Misc
* Getting one in Europe is possible, but it takes a while to arrive and you have to deal with taxes and customs. I don't
know about you, but I don't like dealing with taxes and customs. That's why I took the easy route and set up an alert 
on Germanys equivalent of Craigslist for people selling the Ergodox. I got lucky one evening and ordered one for 275€.  
From others around the internet, I read that customs and taxes will be about 60€ to 90€, so the total price might settle
somewhere around 400€.
* I do not have any problems using other keyboard layouts. I do prefer a ortho split layout, but switching to my MacBook
keyboard is seamless.
