Hi, I'm Chris. This is my personal website, where I write things. As of now, I have no clear idea what those things might be, so I cannot really give a comprehensive summary about that.

The idea of this website is to keep it a simple as possible, only ever adding features when they are needed. Right now, it really isn't more than a collection of article, represented as minimal an functional as possible. As this website grows, the contents of this page will evolve as well.

You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/_chrispop) or shoot me an [email](mailto:mail@mildlyinterested.net) if you happen to want to get in touch with me.

Below, some things the german government wants to have on websites. You can most likely ignore it.
