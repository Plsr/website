Reportty is a small pomodoro timer with minimal taks management added to it. I mostly use this project to learn electron.

I would describe the current state as a MVP. It is possible to cycle through timers, getting notified on finish. In the settings, the lenght of all timers can be adapted.

The idea is to have a list of tasks in the app as well, so the user can start pomodoros for a task and see how much time they spent on it.

Latest release is available [on github](https://github.com/Plsr/reportty/releases). Arm64 mac only at this time. Sorry.

There are other apps out there that do all these things an better. This is just a learning project.
