What I'm currently doing with my life:

* I'm working full time for Railslove. Currently, I'm in between projects, which is always a nice time to slow down a bit, reflect on how the last few months went and where I want to go from here. Also a good chance to pick up some new skills.
* I try to adapt to the changes the corona virus pandemeic brought to all of our lives. This is the first time in my life everything around me has changed so dramatically and it is a little scary.
* I adapt to working from home full time. This is something I wanted to try in the future anyways. Now is as good as any time, I guess.
* I am in the process of quitting social media for the most part. I've deleted some of my accounts and removed the apps of other networks from my phone.
* I try to write more (in general and for this site).
* I try to become a lucid dreamer.
* I'm working on becoming a better boyfriend.
