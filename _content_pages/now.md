What I'm currently doing with my life:

- I'm working full time for Placetel which is a part of Cisco.
- Working on [Next Orange](https://github.com/Plsr/next-orange) in order to learn Next.js and some `react-query`.
  It's really just a Hacker News reader, nothing spectacular, but okay for learning.
- Reading _Zero to One_ (again), _Radical Markets_, _The Martian_ and _Die Kunst kein Egoist zu sein_
- Also reading **a lot** of blogs
