What I'm currently doing with my life:

* I'm working full time for Placetel which is a part of Cisco.
* Moved in with my girlfriend and we're sorting out all our things and how to live together in our small family.
* Learning [Kristijan Kullam√§gi's approach to trading](https://qullamaggie.com/)
* Reading [Thinking in Systems: A Primer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems)
* Building back up my running habit
* Giving emacs another try, as I really admire org-mode and would love to have it integrated in my workflow.
* I'm (still) working on becoming a better boyfriend.
* Trying to get in the habit of updating this page more often than once a year (my current system involves waiting for [Daniel](https://danieldiekmeier.de/) to mock me about it, then waiting some time so he doesn't know I changed it because of him)
