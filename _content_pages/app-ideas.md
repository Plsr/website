### An unorderd list of app ideas

It is likely that all the apps in this list already exist. This is just a list of app I would be interested in
to build because either:

a) the current implementations are not nice
b) it sounds like an interesting problem

- Comparison of climate (median temperature, rain days, ...) between two (or more) cities
- Minimalist RSS reader that opens the sites themselves and has no reader view
- A softphone (SIP Client)
- A micropub server
- Water tracking CLI using the fitbit API
- Personal health/activity dashboard
